summary: "Welcome to six guys messing around on discord voice chat - AKA, the r/teenagers podcast!"
description: "After much fanfare and demand (no star-whoring was involved whatsoever) the mod team, presents: The r/teenagers Podcast Episode 2: Electric Boogaloo! Recorded live on the subreddit’s 10th anniversary! It’s got simping, confessions, questions about the mod life! And it’s most definitely NOT got any mad libs!
\n
\nIt may very well be the worst thing we’ve ever done! Who knows? There’s still a lot more time left in 2020 for us to screw more stuff and episodes up. So, from the faceless, emotionless mods here at teenserv and teensub, we hope from the bottom of whatever we replaced our hearts with, that you’ll enjoy this masterpiece/train wreck! You decide.
